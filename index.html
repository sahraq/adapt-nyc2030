            <p>There are ongoing and significant gaps in accessibility and disability equity with regard to NYC’s cultural institutions and arts programming. ADAptNYC 2030 was started as an initiative to provide better resources, funding, and community around this need. 2030 was selected as a target year to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the ADA and as a reasonable timeline for significant improvement. </p>

<p>This project has come together through the efforts of a number of cultural and arts sector leaders who are engaged in advocacy in NYC culture. A serious need was identified through their work for a standing organization around access for people with disabilities (artists, audience, employees, and other stakeholders) engaged in NYC’s cultural organizations. Some of the focus areas in the scope of this project include education, workforce development, access to equipment and services, and small facility upgrades.</p> 

<p>Important concepts in this work include understanding disability and intersectionality, equity and justice, and the differences between compliance, functional access, and experiential equity.
